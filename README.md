This app is a 'My Store', where the user can shop for items from a list of available products to purchase, add a selected number of items to cart, see the total price and check out. 

The user starts the journey with a landing page. It has some products. Each product is displayed with its name, price, and picture. The user can choose the number of items he/she wants to purchase and click on 'Add to Cart'. The user also can click on the picture of the product to see a description of the product, where there's also a chance for the user to choose the number of items and add the product to cart. The user can navigate to the cart by the main menu. At the cart, the user can change the number of items he/she wants to buy for each product, or completely delete the product from the cart. The total price is diplayed to the user. The user has to fill in a form and then click on a button to complete the purchase.

This is a part of the Udacity's "Angular Cross Skilling nanodegree" program. This project is an assignment for the students to pass the Nanodegree.
Starting code and instructions were provided by Udacity.
