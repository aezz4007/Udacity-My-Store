My name is Amira Ezzeldin. I'm studying Angular.
This page will include all my notes during the building of my-store application.
The project is a part of Angular Nanodegree from Udacity. It's a scholarship provided by EgyFwd.

First, I created an angular app. I installed eslint, as recommended in the classroom.
I made some changes to the karma.conf.js file, because eslint showed some errors.
I'm not sure if I'm going to use Jasmine, or unit testing or so.
I'll just make sure that my project is working properly.
I also installed the Angular material. I think I might use one or two of their ready made components.
I installed prettier and ran it over all the files.

I'll walk through this project with the classroom instructions.
I'll apply the instructions to my-store project.
